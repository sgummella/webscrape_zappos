adidas,Samba® Classic,70,73,82,62,4,5,4,If you are looking for a smart footwear to to wear with any of your jeans then this is the one. Simple and comfortable.
adidas,Samba® Classic,70,73,82,62,5,4,5,"A high school classic back in style - 
This was always one of my favorite shoes back in high school so how stoked was I when I saw it on sale on zappos.com?!?! It's exactly as I remember - SO comfortable and you can wear it with just about anything - too bad my boss doesn't think so . . ."
adidas,Samba® Classic,70,73,82,62,5,5,5,"The Shoes. Ah, the shoes.
What can I say? Perfect fit for a guy like me.
150 lb 5'7 and packed with fury and rage.
Highly recommended for those who dress casual (not boot casual, but like jeans, shirt/jacked etc). 
One thing I dislike is the fact that the front leather (mine is light color) is difficult to clean. Other than that, these shoes are sweet, a must buy!!!"
adidas,Samba® Classic,70,73,82,62,4,5,5,"Great Shoe - 
This shoe is the best adidas shoe out there. They are extremely comfortable(especially when first purchased), they look stylin' with any wear (shorts, pants) and they have extremely good traction for and mold to your feet (great for playing indoor and street soccer).
The only ""constructive criticisms"" I can think of is that after about five or so months the inside wears out and the soles get holes. (Keep in mind this is after wearing them everyday for 5 months.)"
adidas,Samba® Classic,70,73,82,62,5,5,5,"I bought these shoes to wear while biking and they are perfect!  Very light and comfortable, and they slide easily and comfortable into the toe clips.  The top of the shoe can be a bit uncomfortable for the first few days, so I recommend wearing higher socks so it does not rub against your skin.  It only takes a few days before they are completely broken in and you can return to wearing ankle socks."
adidas,Samba® Classic,70,73,82,62,5,5,5,"Great shoe. Used for running, life style, and work (outdoors). Lasted about a year before serious wear showed but they still function after 2 years."

adidas,Superstar 2,80,72,85,60,5,5,5,"Classic Adidas lover - 
I just had to have these shoes once I laid my eyes on them and I am completely happy that I got them. Not only are they comfortable, they are indeed fabulous to look at and Adidas is one of the best brands to wear. Plus delivery was top notch."
adidas,Superstar 2,80,72,85,60,5,5,5,This shoes is extremely comfortable and looks great! Make sure to buy half size than your regular size because these shoes run small.
adidas,Superstar 2,80,72,85,60,5,5,5,"Love these shoes, I have been buying these shoes since I was in high school.  You can walk for hours in them with out your feet getting tired.  I would say this is a good shoe for people with normal to wide feet, if your feet are super narrow it may not work."
adidas,Superstar 2,80,72,85,60,5,5,5,Love them!! Used to have them when I worked in a sporting good store in high school. That was almost 30 years ago. Brought back great memory's  they rock!!
adidas,Superstar 2,80,72,85,60,5,5,5,I am very pleased with Zappos' service. The shoes came about three days after I ordered them and I was very pleased with my purchase!

Brooks,Addiction™ Walker,120,88,89,,1,1,1,"After debating whether or not I could justify the price of the Brooks Walker, I went ahead and purchased a pair in February. The shoes felt great out of the box-a tad more roomy at the top then I'm used to- I had ordered them in wide after reading the reviews-but certainly within reason. After wearing them every day for 3 months, the leather fabric has stretched out and broken down to the point that I'm rolling out the sides and swimming from side to side. Worn out after 3 months? And this is what Brooks testifies to be the expected lifespan? How can a company make a shoe that is expected to last 4 months and then charge."
Brooks,Addiction™ Walker,120,88,89,,5,4,5,"A Perfect Fit - No Complaints - 
Received shoes in the early afternoon and tried them out right away. Went for a 3.5 mile walk without experiencing any discomfort or problems. Keep up the good work. I've purchased several walking shoes from ZAPPOS and never had any problems. Always read customer's reviews when preparing to purchase shoes."
Brooks,Addiction™ Walker,120,88,89,,5,5,5,"Shoe was true to size.  However it did wear out fast, with daily use."
Brooks,Addiction™ Walker,120,88,89,,5,5,5,"This is my second pair. I have high arches, and these are some of the most comfortable walking shoes I have found. I also like the ""subdued"" style. Too many athletic shoes these days make you look like you came from outer space."
Brooks,Addiction™ Walker,120,88,89,,5,4,5,"These are good shoes. I do not feel any pain, and they are comfortable. They gave me the bounce in walking that I used to have. These shoes look as good as any other shoes that I have seen. I have to agree that they are not true to size and I had to order another pair one size bigger."
Brooks,Addiction™ Walker,120,88,89,,5,5,5,"Great support for flat feet!
My husband has flat feet, so when he started a new job where he was walking outside for hours, his feet and ankles were in such constant pain he was worried he'd have to quit. I realized his sneakers barely gave his feet any support, so I looked online and saw these on nearly every list of ""best walking shoes for flat feet"" and thought he should give them a try. The footbed in these is not particularly soft, but along with shock-absorbing inserts (Dr. Scholls Custom Fit), these shoes seem to really be doing the trick. He has told me that his feet and ankles feel a thousand times better, even after pounding the pavement all day. Definitely recommend if you have flat feet!
He did have to exchange the first pair we got for half a size up, so you may want to order two, just to make sure, and then return the one that doesn't fit (returns are so easy and pain-free here, there's really no reason not to)."
Brooks,Addiction™ Walker,120,88,89,,5,4,5,"This is my second pair in eight years, and my first narrow width (B) sneaker type shoes in many years. They are truly comfortable walking shoes that I wear with orthotics. They are highly recommended."

Converse,Chuck Taylor® All Star® Core Hi,54.99,66,92,,3,4,3,"I love the style but have to say the quality of the shoes may not be up tp par with other brands. There is little arch support, you need to spen a quite of bit of time \'breaking into\' them. If you have wide feet like myself, then it can occasion pinch your toes. Other than that it is pretty comfortable."

Converse,Chuck Taylor® All Star® Core Hi,54.99,66,92,,5,5,5,"The shoe - 
I ordered these for my son. After we had been to two stores, either they didn’t have his size or the color he wanted, I said to him just order them at Zappos, you won't be disappointed, so we ordered them you had them in his size and the color he wanted (red). When he got them he was excited, he got them in three days like you said, but he had ordered them a size too big, why I don't know. So I called your customer service (very helpful) sent out another pair right away, received them (right size) thank goodness,very happy with the turn out, thank you so much."
Converse,Chuck Taylor® All Star® Core Hi,54.99,66,92,,5,5,5,Zappos was true to their word. I ordered these at 7:00 p.m. and they arrived the next afternoon at 3:00. They cost less than any store here in CT and strangers on the street have stopped me to see where i bought them. Zappos has excellent customer service.
Converse,Chuck Taylor® All Star® Core Hi,54.99,66,92,,4,5,5,I wore these underneath my wedding dress for the reception and they were a hit! I am in love with them and try to rock them as much as I can!
Converse,Chuck Taylor® All Star® Core Hi,54.99,66,92,,3,5,5,They are awesome. They fit great. Look nice.
Converse,Chuck Taylor® All Star® Core Hi,54.99,66,92,,5,5,5,This was my first pair of Converse and I absolutely love them! Probably best shoe I ever bought! I recommend them! I would also recommend getting some Vans Authentic Core Classic! They are probably just as good as the Converse!
Converse,Chuck Taylor® All Star® Core Hi,54.99,66,92,,3,5,3,"Old School Shoes.  
I've been playing basketball for almost 10 years and I've never had a pair of shoes as good as the old school ""Chuck Taylor Converse"" basketball shoes.  They're cheap, durable, and the best shoe for any real ball player!"
Converse,Chuck Taylor® All Star® Core Hi,54.99,66,92,,5,5,5,"Always a quality product, my kids and I have gone through many of these and have always loved them."

Converse,Chuck Taylor® All Star® Core Ox,49.99,61,92,,2,5,2,"These shoes are good, but if your looking to bounce up and down and to an aerobics routine for about 7 min, they are horrible. They break easily every time you bounce."
Converse,Chuck Taylor® All Star® Core Ox,49.99,61,92,,5,5,3,Not a huge fan. I got these..and there is just something about them being all black that makes them very anti-Chuck-Taylor. I obviously saw they were all black when buying them and thought they would be kind of cool. They look weird in real life.
Converse,Chuck Taylor® All Star® Core Ox,49.99,61,92,,4,4,4,"Good looks...not so great fit.
These seemed to run a little big. Not that comfy. Good look'n though, so have to wear them."
Converse,Chuck Taylor® All Star® Core Ox,49.99,61,92,,4,5,4,"Order down one size - 
The company was most helpful when I had to keep sending the shoe back b/c it was too big, but nevertheless, more help with sizing would ease the frustration and trouble of having to keep reordering and sending packages back. Thank you."
Converse,Chuck Taylor® All Star® Core Ox,49.99,61,92,,4,4,4,"A good-looking classic. The blue is slightly faded, like a dark denim. Not much support, but then again you don't expect it with Chucks. I put inserts into them, and it works just fine. These are my 13 year old daughter's shoes, and she wears them nearly every day."
Converse,Chuck Taylor® All Star® Core Ox,49.99,61,92,,5,5,5,"CHUCKS!
Yay for chucks. These are awesome classics. It's a shame they're so expensive now though."
Converse,Chuck Taylor® All Star® Core Ox,49.99,61,92,,5,5,5,Have many pairs of this shoe and they always fit and look great. I always get a half size smaller to fit well.
Converse,Chuck Taylor® All Star® Core Ox,49.99,61,92,,5,5,5,"I'm wearing these little guys right now and I like 'em! But they are Chucks so what's not to like? Although if you've never had them, I usually wear a size 10 but in Chucks I wear a 9."
Converse,Chuck Taylor® All Star® Core Ox,49.99,61,92,,5,5,5,"I just bought 6 pairs of these shoes.  One for me, and five for my groomsmen. We wore them in my wedding this weekend, and they were perfect.  I fully recommend these shoes to anyone getting married."
Converse,Chuck Taylor® All Star® Core Ox,49.99,61,92,,5,5,5,Perfect shoe for girls with larger feet! My 19 year old daughter wears size 12 womens shoes and its usually near impossible to find name brand shoes in her size since most shoe outlets only carry up to US 10 or 11 for womens. That's why she loves Converses because they are unisex and run in larger sizes. She fits perfectly in a size 12 womens Converse.
Converse,Chuck Taylor® All Star® Core Ox,49.99,61,92,,5,5,5,Bought them for my son. Got what he wanted. Great all round shoe and looks good. Got them on time and in great shape. Only Zappos delivers what they say they are going to do. So get zapped and have fun. These guys stand behind their products.
Converse,Chuck Taylor® All Star® Core Ox,49.99,61,92,,5,5,5,"These are timeless shoes that will never go out of style. They work for every age, gender and personal style. A practical and casual shoe that's worth every dollar!"
Converse,Chuck Taylor® All Star® Core Ox,49.99,61,92,,5,5,5,"Love these! Chuck Taylors (for me, at least) run the same size as my athletic shoes, not my flats, so I just got the same size I normally wear in tennis shoes (an 8). Fits great, adorable red color! They've got basically no arch support, but if you don't mind that they're really comfy."
Converse,Chuck Taylor® All Star® Core Ox,49.99,61,92,,5,5,5,Comfortable classics that we all know and love. Size down a half or a whole size.
Converse,Chuck Taylor® All Star® Core Ox,49.99,61,92,,5,5,5,"I bought these for my husband, who had a pair for over 20 years, and wanted another. I would have liked to get them in orange again! Zappos recommended getting half a size smaller than usual. So I ordered 11½, and they fit him perfectly. I love the free shipping, for returns also, it is great! I am going to order Chucks for myself!"
Converse,Chuck Taylor® All Star® Core Ox,49.99,61,92,,5,5,5,"This was my first time ordering from Zappos.com, and this will not be the last! I ordered my shoes on Friday and they were at my door Monday morning. Anyway, this was my third pair, simply because I love these shoes so much. They're classic and you really can't go wrong with a good 'ol pair of Chucks. If you're getting a women's size, definitely order a 1/2 size smaller. I wear a 7 in most shoes and the 6 1/2 is perfect. The width actually felt a tad bit wider than my last pair, which is great. I'm used to the lack of arch support, but it's nothing an insole can't fix. If you're thinking about getting these shoes, just go ahead and get these. I wear these every day and I love them!"

Converse,Jack Purcell® CP Canvas Low Top,64.99,68,87,65,2,2,2,"I just have to echo the other reviews that have mentioned the unfortunate changes. These used to be the most comfortable shoes, but no longer. As others have said, they feel cheaper and considerably less comfortable. I have been so disappointed in the new ones that I gave up on them (after almost a decade of consecutive purchases) until I found a five-year old pair in my closet. I put those on and was amazed at how much more comfortable than the new version. This isn't just a fear a of change, it is a totally inferior product. What a bummer, converse really ruined my favorite shoes."
Converse,Jack Purcell® CP Canvas Low Top,64.99,68,87,65,4,5,4,"Back in the day - 
I owned my first pair of Jack Purcells in 1961 when I was 9 years old. All of the surfers wore them...they were the rage. I own a pair now and I feel just like I did then...cool and still young--buy some. I'm now 52 yrs old andI love my Jack Purcells! I just bought my boss some--he wore them too..."
Converse,Jack Purcell® CP Canvas Low Top,64.99,68,87,65,4,5,5,"Old school kicks - 
This shoe is worth the buy,ive worn a pair back in college, and  just got another one a month ago, I was in luck coz this type of shoe is really rare here in our place, it goes well with any type of clothing, very cool!"
Converse,Jack Purcell® CP Canvas Low Top,64.99,68,87,65,3,5,5,"The perfect Tybee Island retro tennis, beach, and boat shoe without being the overly popular Chuck Taylors and more importantly without little horses on them."
Converse,Jack Purcell® CP Canvas Low Top,64.99,68,87,65,5,4,5,"I had been considering these shoes on a recommendation for a good while, and I finally went ahead and got them. I am so glad I did! These are the white canvas sneakers you are looking for. The fit is fine, though if you are looking for good arch support - which isn't a big deal to me personally - in spite of good padding, these really won't be any different than Chuck Taylors. Their look is really tough to beat, however, especially when worn with no-show footies/liners for socks. By far, these have to be one of the best footwear decisions I've made."
Converse,Jack Purcell® CP Canvas Low Top,64.99,68,87,65,5,5,5,"Let me start off by saying that I have never ever left feedback on any site in my life and I make tons of online purchases. I ordered these in a size 8 from Journeys and they were too small. They wanted 8 bucks to return them and then another 8 bucks to ship me the new pair in an 8.5. That's just crazy so I came here and ordered them around 7p.m. and got the free 4-5 day shipping. They came the next day! I was blown away. Free shipping and they were delivered to my door in less than 18 hours, that's insane! Thank you so much Zappos! You're amazing! I love the shoes too, I had an old pair that I ruined by trying to wash them and put them in the washing machine and drying them in the dryer, not a good idea."
Converse,Jack Purcell® CP Canvas Low Top,64.99,68,87,65,5,5,5,"Aw. I don't think a classic Jack Purcell really needs a review from me. If you're buying this shoe it's because you probably know it and love it already. It's a flat basic great looking fresh and preppy canvas shoe, and/or can be worn in hipster vernacular as well. If you require arch support add an insert as they do not provide support. They are awesome if you prefer to go without socks as they breathe and don't become stinky. I stuff mine with brown paper bags though after wearing so maybe that's why mine stay nice. I have had probably 25 pairs over the course of my lifetime. Total standby. Cute with short dresses, jeans, outfits. The whole enchilada. But a half-size smaller than you wear for snug/good fit."
Converse,Jack Purcell® CP Canvas Low Top,64.99,68,87,65,5,5,5,"I. Love. This. Shoe. It's got more support than the original Chuck and really stinkin' cute too! I wish it came in more colors, because I'd buy them all!"

I mainly got this shoe because of the style. It's very popular. The leather stretches more than the canvas. Which means they do get a little more comfortable as you wear them. The width is on the narrow side as all converse shoes. The sizing is always strange. I normally wear a women's 81/2 and these are 71/2. If my foot was narrow I would have bought the 7. These shoes are o.k. for casual wear but not for serious walking."

These shoes are already ripping out in the toes and the tread is almost completely smooth. My son is 10 and weights 75 lbs. He is not overweight to be wearing out these shoes this fast. And we they are not too small. His toes do not touch the top of the shoe yet. He has only worn them for 3 weeks at school. Very disappointed. And according to the return policy, I can not return them."

Nike,Air Monarch IV,59.07,88,91,59,4,4,1,"Love these shoes, but squeak, squeak, squeak. And these are my second pair. Same problem."
Nike,Air Monarch IV,59.07,88,91,59,5,5,3,"This is 4th pair of Monarchs for me. Although it is a comfortable shoe, these are not as good as the early ones. They had a better grip on the bottom, and just a more durable feel. This being a lower scale Nike shoe, the price from Nike could be a bit lower. With heavy use you will get about 9 months out of a pair. The black ones ripped quicker than the white ones did for me. So it just comes down to how long you want the shoe to last, vs price, for what you will use it for work or play. I would try a sharper pair of Asics if it were for play or going out. For the folks suffering with squeaks, take out the foot pad and put in some baby powder...then back in...for some reason it works wonders."
Nike,Air Monarch IV,59.07,88,91,59,5,4,4,"Big footers! Attention! OK, look no further because this is your shoe. True to its size! If you feel like you have the foot of a caveman, like myself so get the wider version and fall in love!"
Nike,Air Monarch IV,59.07,88,91,59,5,5,5,"I'm a big guy, shoes holds up very good. Great shoe for the price. wear a pair every day to work."
Nike,Air Monarch IV,59.07,88,91,59,5,5,5,Every year my husband has Air Monarchs on his Christmas list as they are so amazingly comfortable. He always gets white and this year I found these with grey on Zappos. I have bought these shoes for years and never seen this color and bought them immediately. On my screen they look to also have yellow on them but it is actually a florescent green. They are great shoes that I highly recommend and Zappos was great to deal with! This was my first dealing and I will certainly buy from them again!
Nike,Air Monarch IV,59.07,88,91,59,4,5,5,I feel they have solved the support problem I had with the Air III's. This shoe fits my wide foot great.
Nike,Air Monarch IV,59.07,88,91,59,5,5,5,"I like Nikes, but some are really expensive. Not these, I just bought these about a week ago in white/silver. All my shoes get dirty fast including these and I don't see the point of buying expensive Nikes."

Saucony Originals,Jazz Low Pro,42.99,87,95,70,2,4,3,"I was a little unsure about buying shoes online since there's more to getting a good fit than just a size number. But personal circumstances made mail order the best option right now. To be safe, I ordered two different models, this Saucony Jazz Low Pro and the New Balance M574, both in size 8, thinking that I would keep the one that fit best (or keep both if they fit equally well). 

This shoe had a lot going for  it. It is softer and cushier than the NB M574, and when I first slipped them on they felt like puffy clouds, but then I laced them up. The length of the shoe from heel to toe was perfect, a tiny bit better than the NB M574 in that regard. But the fit across the top of my foot was a bit too tight, even after loosening the laces as much as possible. Even so, a test walk back and forth across the living room wasn't bad, but compared to the M574 I felt less confident in my stride. I think that had something to do with the relatively flat ""low profile"" heel.

So I'm reluctantly returning these. If they had fit better across the top of my feet I would keep them, because otherwise they are pretty comfortable. However, the NB M574s are better suited to my needs."
Saucony Originals,Jazz Low Pro,42.99,87,95,70,5,5,5,"Great shoe! I love it!
I loved the shoe. This is my second Saucony and I absolutely love the shoes. They are so comfortable and I love the classic look."
Saucony Originals,Jazz Low Pro,42.99,87,95,70,5,4,5,Very comfortable and they were shipped to me the next day.
Saucony Originals,Jazz Low Pro,42.99,87,95,70,5,5,5,"These are the most comfortable shoes I have ever purchased. The sizing is right on and they last a long time. I exercise in these, as well as kick back and relax."
Saucony Originals,Jazz Low Pro,42.99,87,95,70,5,5,5,"I love these shoes. I've had probably 5 or 6 pairs over the last 4-5 years. They're my go-to everyday sneaker, whether I'm going to work, the bar, or just running errands on the weekend. They're affordable, which is good since they do tend to wear out after 8-12 months of solid wear. For the price, I'd say that's a pretty fair deal. I usually take out the insole and put in some Superfeet for a little extra support and stability, since what's there is minimal. They look great with jeans or shorts, and while I wouldn't recommend using them as an actual running shoe, they're great for almost everything else. I've tried branching out to other brands and styles, but I always end up coming back to these. Plus, great colors. The Saucony Jazz Lo Pro rules, and Zappos rules, too."

Give these shoes 2 days and they will become the most comfortable shoe you've ever worn. As for the appearance, the hemp/canvas combo is a little on the Simple-brand/Birkenstock end of the spectrum, and perhaps some nylon accents in place of hemp might make the shoe look a little more like a trainer and less like a hacky-sacker's dream. That said, they're still pretty sharp and incredibly comfortable."
Saucony Originals,Jazz Low Pro Vegan,42.99,88,95,75,5,5,5,The shoe is breaking in well and provides reasonable support for walking and working out in. Plus it looks cool.
Saucony Originals,Jazz Low Pro Vegan,42.99,88,95,75,5,5,5,"Had to move down a shoe size to get it to fit, but the most comfortable should I was able to find after trying at least 10 different pairs."
Saucony Originals,Jazz Low Pro Vegan,42.99,88,95,75,4,5,5,"Love these sneakers! My husband is so hard to please when it comes to fit and comfort for sneakers and this pair is one of the few that he elected to keep. The canvas is very breathable, the green color is very attractive and the fact that the edging makes it two-tone is really handsome. The fit was perfect, his only 'if only' is that the sole could be a little more cushy and fitted. But overall he says 'these are pretty damn good' - high praise from him! These are now the date sneakers when we are going out for casual dining and dress shoes are not needed. Works for me, I think they look great!"

I bought a 1/2 size up - turns out I should have gotten a size and a half larger. Good for casual wear, though. But I can't run in these at all. Far too snug. Do not buy these if you have wide feet."

Saucony Originals,Bullet,44.99,59,84,55,5,5,5,"Awesome shoes, stylish and practical for the gym. I love these shoes and would definitely purchase another pair. If you're looking for a supportive running shoe, may want to look into Nikes, but these do work for shorter runs or intervals. I like retro sneakers so I will endure the pain."
Saucony Originals,Bullet,44.99,59,84,55,5,5,5,"Fantastic, lightweight shoe with more heel cushion than most other shoes of similar style I've tried."
Saucony Originals,Bullet,44.99,59,84,55,5,5,5,"These shoes are super low profile. They have no ankle support. They feel more like slippers than shoes. They are extremely comfortable and lightweight so I will keep them, but I don't think I would buy these shoes again."

They are well-made; the rubber soles are substantial and the footbed gives decent support for a shoe of this type. I am a true 9B and the shoes feel a bit large; if you intend to wear these shoes without socks or with thin ones, you may want to consider buying a half-size down."
Superga,2750 COTU Classic Sneaker,64.95,56,71,57,5,5,5,"Super cute! I ordered a half size smaller and they fit well - not too tight, not too loose. I bought them in black and think they're really cute and a nice grown-up alternative to Converse."
Superga,2750 COTU Classic Sneaker,64.95,56,71,57,5,5,5,"Very comfortable. I was worried about size, because some reviews said they were too big. Maybe, I could have gone done a half size.

Vans,Era™,59.95,88,91,59,2,3,3,"Very cute but not the best for comfort - 
I got these adorable Vans with the hound dogs on them. True to Vans nature, they are fairly narrow and not too comfy. Maybe they just need a longer breaking in period. I normally wear Chucks, (Converse) and although Chucks are also not the most comfortable sneaker made, they offer a little bit more toe room and a little wider shoe. I think I'll stick to Converse from here on out."
Vans,Era™,59.95,88,91,59,4,4,4,These are lightweight and cool looking but offer no support.
Vans,Era™,59.95,88,91,59,4,5,5,"Vans Era Galinsky print - 
A little smaller than my last pair (Dogtown Eras), but with the free returns it was no problem exchanging them for a bigger size."
Vans,Era™,59.95,88,91,59,4,5,5,"New and improved - 
I got the Vans Era 56. They’re not listed as Era 56 on Zappos.com, but I really love them because they have the classic Vans look and feel, but they're more durable than regular Vans Eras because they're leather instead of the classic canvas. As a cabinetmaker and skater, I'm rubbing around on my shoes a lot, and canvas would wear out too quick. The other feature I love about them is that the collar is padded and leather so they slip on and off nicer than the canvas bare bones Eras."
Vans,Era™,59.95,88,91,59,5,5,5,"Never a disappointment - I've had soooo many pairs of Vans Eras and I'm never unhappy. These new suede croc print ones, however, are the best yet. Not significantly heavier than the standard canvas ones, but you can tell a difference. Normally I would get a new pair every month and half roughly, due to the canvas blowing out. I've had the espresso suede ones for about a month, and they're holding up way better than the canvas would. If you skate, and want your Eras to last a little longer, I'd suggest getting yourself some. Besides that, they are a good chill shoe, with all the colors and all."
Vans,Era™,59.95,88,91,59,5,5,5,"Great colorway from Vans.  Saw these in California, but couldn\'t find my size.  Ordered from Zappos, got here quickly.  I would recommend this if you can\'t find you shoes in store."
Vans,Era™,59.95,88,91,59,5,5,5,I do not usally order online but my daugther found Zappos and wanted a pair of shoes so I asked a couple of stores in the mall have they heard of Zappos and they had and they even mention that Zappos is usually cheaper than them and you don\'t pay sales tax.  The experience was great we have since orderded another pair and you get your product in about 2-3 business days.  I would order from Zappos anytime. Thanks Zappos
Vans,Era™,59.95,88,91,59,5,5,5,Great looking shoe. Color combo is hella sweet. Looks awesome with shorts or jeans.
Vans,Era™,59.95,88,91,59,5,5,5,"Long time wearer of Vans - 
I have been an avid Vans fan since day one and I have found them to be the most comfortable shoe for whatever activity I am doing. I still have a pair that I bought over 12 years ago that I wear on special outings with my motorcycle friends and after a long ride they sure feel good on my feet when I change out of my riding boots. My kids are hooked on the styles and comfort as well, and now my grandkids wear them too! When it comes to comfort, Vans is #1 for me and my family! THANKS!"
Vans,Era™,59.95,88,91,59,4,5,5,"Don't shop anywhere else.
My son wanted the black/pewter Vans shoe so bad. We looked and looked in so many stores in San Diego. No one had his size. So I suggested we look on Zappos.com to find the shoe. Unfortunately you were so sold out. What's great is that we requested a certain size and left our email address so that we would be notified when you got the shoe in. Low and behold we got the email notice a few days later. I quickly ordered the shoe. No shipping fees, I love it. The shoe came in a couple days. What great service. I love your company."
Vans,Era™,59.95,88,91,59,4,5,5,Great shoes! But if you put a lot of pressure on your heels when walking (as I do) the insoles tend to wear down pretty fast. Just a warning.

Along with the classic Converse Chuck Taylor high tops, the Vans SK8-Hi are incredible. I'm 31 years old now and I have found that the recent crop of Nike, Reebok, and Adidas just don't speak to me anymore. I'm not interested in the latest moonboot or LeBron James or Allen Iverson ""inspired"" shoe. I want something that looks relevant, but not reaching. That is where Vans and Converse come in. I used to skate back in the day and this shoe brings back some good memories. The style is very similar to that of the ""Chuck"" but the ankle support is stronger and the shoe is a bit heavier, but not burdensome. The only downside is that the upper portion of the shoe rubs my ankle a bit at times, but that is negligible. The stiching is solid and the shoe just has a good overall feel. Do yourself a favor and pick up some Vans, any style, I don't believe you'll be dissapointed."
Vans,SK8-Hi™ Core Classics,64.95,83,94,55,5,5,5,"Impossible shipping speed - 
I can't hardly believe how fast the shipping is. I ordered online after dinner on a Sunday woke up early Monday and the shoes were at the door mysteriously. Has Zappos found a way to teleport items? You tell me.
Zappos is number 1 in my book! Can't be beat!"
Vans,SK8-Hi™ Core Classics,64.95,83,94,55,5,4,5,"Vans rock!
These old school vans remind me of my high school days in the 80's. I love these shoes and I will no doubt buy some more in other colors. These tennies have plenty of width."
Vans,SK8-Hi™ Core Classics,64.95,83,94,55,5,5,5,"Great Shoes!
I have been wearing Vans shoes for about 28 years. I love the look and style, and the way the shoe fits. Besides these Sk8 Hi Vans, also look for the Sk8 Mids, Slip Ons, Authentics, Era 45, Half Cabs, and other Vans, which are all available here at Zappos! You will not be disappointed."

Vans,Old Skool™,59.95,88,95,64,1,4,2,The shoes are very yummy.  They are exactly as I expected them to be.  The breaking out of the shoe is taking longer than I expected.  Its still scraping my ankle raw until I can wear it out a little.

Vans,Old Skool™,59.95,88,95,64,5,5,5,I just love this brand and these shoes in particular. The black/pewter combo is super sharp and they are so easy to break in. I like that they sort of mold to your foot and are made to be worn unlike so many other shoes out there that are made to be looked at.

Vans,Classic Slip-On™,49.95,79,89,59,1,5,1,Returning them as they ran small/narrow. They looked like they might be comfortable but unable to get them on.
Vans,Classic Slip-On™,49.95,79,89,59,2,5,3,"Compared Slip-Ons - 
My last pair of Slip-Ons were Emericas. I wore them into the ground, they were great. These are heavier and have a rim around the top back of the heel that rubs."
Vans,Classic Slip-On™,49.95,79,89,59,3,5,4,"Comfortable and cool, though may take some breaking in - 
I ordered these in two styles: brown with pink dotting and black skull/helix print, thinking I'd return the pair I liked least. But I've decided to keep them both--I love the way they look! They fit well, though the inner rim rubs a bit. I've needed Band-aids the first couple of times I've worn them, but I think they'll break in. Overall, I'm very pleased."
Vans,Classic Slip-On™,49.95,79,89,59,3,5,4,"THESE ARE TUTEALLY AWSOME!
I love these shoes over all look. But whatever you do DO NOT bleach them. The side plastic however does wear out easily and shortly. If you do not plan on wearing them every day then these are over all great shoes."
Vans,Classic Slip-On™,49.95,79,89,59,4,4,4,"Turquoise Vans - 
Fun looking shoes. Takes me back to junior high."
Vans,Classic Slip-On™,49.95,79,89,59,4,5,4,"Iron Maiden shoes, oh yeah! The shoes are great looking and very comfortable for walking or doing something casual. Of course they are not athletic shoes and don't have a lot of shock to take for activity but they are casual shoes. Anyhow, great price, great look."
Vans,Classic Slip-On™,49.95,79,89,59,5,5,4,Comfortable and perfect! Get a shoe just a bit smaller than your normal size so that the back of the shoe does not slip up and down against your heel.
Vans,Classic Slip-On™,49.95,79,89,59,5,5,5,"Awesome - 
These shoes are fantastic. I bought a pair last year right before Ii traveled to England and France, 3 weeks of intense walking was put into these shoes. I’ve had this pair for a year and a half and they're still holding together and looking great. I recommend these shoes for the laid back type that wants a comfortable, long-lasting shoe."
Vans,Classic Slip-On™,49.95,79,89,59,5,5,5,"Zappos rocks!
Zappos is great for finding Van's slip-ons, my son's favorite shoes. They are no cheaper anywhere and delivery is very fast! I've ordered 3 pairs so far--no problems at all.
Peace out,
Ed's mom"
Vans,Classic Slip-On™,49.95,79,89,59,4,5,5,"The Ultimate Summer Shoe - 
This is a very comfortable shoe for summer walking or just casual activities. Its simple look compliments most clothing ensembles."
Vans,Classic Slip-On™,49.95,79,89,59,5,5,5,"Very happy with shoe, fit just right, and as always it's a pleasure doing business with Zappos."
Vans,Classic Slip-On™,49.95,79,89,59,4,5,5,"Cute!!
OMG! I love this brand; the slip-ons are cute and comfy. The only problem is that they fit a little bit wider than marked, but I just wear some ankle socks and it’s all good. I recommend the black ones with the pink hippos, they are so adorable."
Vans,Classic Slip-On™,49.95,79,89,59,5,5,5,"Cute but stiff - 
I'd read other reviews and ignored them about the stiff heels on this shoe. Alas, it is true. I love the way these shoes look. They are very cute. They are also deceptively comfortable at first. I have only worn them one day, a long day on my feet. My left shoe wore a deep blister in my heel that is still healing. I had to go back to my trust Born slip-ons. The shoe was not too tight, it was if there was a thick bump on the inside edge of the heel. The right shoe fit fine. I suspect I will be happy with these shoes once they are broken in, but I don't usually have the need to ""break in"" shoes."
Vans,Classic Slip-On™,49.95,79,89,59,5,5,5,"A very nice shoe. The length was good but the width can be a bit tight when you first get them but after breaking-in, the size is perfect."
Vans,Classic Slip-On™,49.95,79,89,59,5,5,5,"My son loves his new Vans - 
My son tells me that the shoes are sporty and comfortable. I hope that he gets good wear from them, he tends to be hard on shoes."
Vans,Classic Slip-On™,49.95,79,89,59,5,5,5,"My 11-year-old son loves these - 
My son loves these, and they're ""cool"" for middle school. I can't comment on the fit because my son tells me that everything about this shoe is great."
Vans,Classic Slip-On™,49.95,79,89,59,5,5,5,"Always a great shoe!  Not the best if you have really narrow feet, but these shoes are comfortable and great to wear with casual and formal attire!"
Vans,Classic Slip-On™,49.95,79,89,59,5,5,5,"My niece brought you site to my attention as she was looking at a pair of shoes she wanted, the Vans slip-on. The ordering process couldn't have been easier, and the delivery couldn't have been quicker. She is thrilled with them and was so happy to have received them within 3 days after I ordered them. I would highly recommend Zappos to anyone."
Vans,Classic Slip-On™,49.95,79,89,59,4,5,5,"They run small. I needed to get one size up from what I ordered, but otherwise great shoe. Love everything about them."
Vans,Classic Slip-On™,49.95,79,89,59,5,5,5,"Great shoes, they are extremely comfertable and fitting. Excellent for gift ideas."
Vans,Classic Slip-On™,49.95,79,89,59,5,5,5,"These shoes run half a size smaller than my normal shoe size.  They are very comfortable, light and durable.  Very stylish shoes.  Great price for a great shoe.  I would definitely recommend this shoe to others."
Vans,Classic Slip-On™,49.95,79,89,59,5,5,5,"These things last forever. I have two pairs. One is four years old, the other I have had for a year. The older ones are blue, and due to that they have shown some stains and a slight amount of rubber peeling, but no significant damage at all. The newer pair, the 'espresso' color, is not only in better condition (no stains or anything), but I personally say it is the best color offered by Vans. It is a very nice brown that goes with anything, and you never have to worry about it not matching due to the style on it. Plus, since the espresso ones are just solid brown, you can get away with wearing them as an adult to nearly any occasion. I doubt the same can be said for the checkerboard pattern. Only downside is one shared with all Vans slip-on shoes: no arch support."
Vans,Classic Slip-On™,49.95,79,89,59,5,5,5,"Vans can't be beat for a great knock around shoe, the Slip-On is the best of them."
Vans,Classic Slip-On™,49.95,79,89,59,5,5,5,I’m upset The only shoes I can wear right now are vans AF1 toms anyways I have neuropathy and I needed a pair of new shoes that would not bother my feet while I’m sitting in my wheelchair and these look like someone else wore them they’ve already got a crease my shoes don’t crease! It upsets me that I got the shoes this way. I need them I don’t have time to send them back.
Vans,Classic Slip-On™,49.95,79,89,59,5,5,5,"Shoes - 
I had been looking for the checker pattern all over and found them here. They fit great, feel great and I love them. Money well spent."
Vans,Classic Slip-On™,49.95,79,89,59,5,5,5,Very fast delivery! Pleased with the style and color. Very comfortable!
Vans,Classic Slip-On™,49.95,79,89,59,5,5,5,I bought this slip on two weeks ago and they fit wonderful and I go by quick when I'm in a hurry. I bought the blue checkerboard and they look great whatever I wear. I recommend to purchase these shoes.
Vans,Classic Slip-On™,49.95,79,89,59,4,5,4,Love these shoes! A tad difficult to get on but I feel like it will get easier the more I break the shoes in.

The shoe is already coming unglued where the white side piece meets the black color of the shoe. We ordered the same shoe is white and black and the same thing is happening on both shoes."
Vans,Authentic™ Core Classics,49.95,88,94,57,4,5,4,I love Vans but being a girl and having big feet I couldn't find my size in stores. It was just impossible but now I wear them all the time and my feet love them.
Vans,Authentic™ Core Classics,49.95,88,94,57,5,5,5,"Off The Wall Vans - 
I like the feel of this shoe but was disappointed in the shade of blue. Supposed to be Navy blue but to my eye they are a lighter shade."
Vans,Authentic™ Core Classics,49.95,88,94,57,4,5,5,My son loves these shoes.  Owns several pair in different colors.  He uses this pair for work.  Thanks for carrying them in size 14!
Vans,Authentic™ Core Classics,49.95,88,94,57,5,5,5,"Been wearing Vans for at least 10 years - I'm in the service industry and they are hands-down the most comfortable (and reasonably non-slip) shoes to walk around in all day. From what I can tell, slip-ons, prison, and these are all sized the same - I wear a 9 in women's sizes and a 7 in these. The blue is a little darker than crayola blue."
Vans,Authentic™ Core Classics,49.95,88,94,57,5,5,5,"Simply put, this is my favorite pair of shoes ever. They are great for skating or wearing out on the town. They are easy to wear with pants or shorts and just as comfortable as they are cheap! Get them or you are bluffing hard."
Vans,Authentic™ Core Classics,49.95,88,94,57,5,5,5,"I purchased these for my son, size 10D.  He seemed to like them, and they fit well.  As usual, it was easy to order from Zappos. Thanks for the ease in shipping!"
Vans,Authentic™ Core Classics,49.95,88,94,57,5,5,5,"Love 'em. Perfect, classic canvas kicks. Wear 'em with shorts, jeans, whatever. Socks, no socks (get some odor eater spray!) - it works. Must have a pair in blue and black."
Vans,Authentic™ Core Classics,49.95,88,94,57,5,5,5,"My son wears size 15/16; it is very difficult to find that size...let alone that size and what you like. Zappos has what he likes, good rates and they are always shipped very fast! I love Zappos!"

Vans,Old Skool™ Core Classics,59.95,85,93,62,1,4,2,I love the look and feel of this shoe. My low rating is because Vans no longer concerns themselves with making a quality shoe. I have owned this pair for a year now and it has fallen apart. I have bought several other pairs (of Vans) over the last few years and all of them have fallen apart after 6 months to a year. I have a pair I bought in 1996 that has held up longer than then the pair I bought just a year ago. So I am done with Vans until they can deliver a quality pair of shoes.
Vans,Old Skool™ Core Classics,59.95,85,93,62,4,5,4,"Vans Old Skool - 
Shoe is cool looking, runs about a 1/2 size smaller. No arch support, lightweight."
Vans,Old Skool™ Core Classics,59.95,85,93,62,5,5,5,"Old Skool - 
Love these shoes. My husband has been wearing Vans since high school and his skater days (which were in the eighties). They looked great then and look great now."
Vans,Old Skool™ Core Classics,59.95,85,93,62,5,5,5,"Get a pair of Vans!
These shoes are great!!! They fit just like I remember... but whatever you wear in the Slip-Ons, order a half size larger because they have laces. I heart you Zappos & so do my feet!"
Vans,Old Skool™ Core Classics,59.95,85,93,62,5,5,5,"THESE SHOES RULE!!!
No other shoe looks or feels better!"
Vans,Old Skool™ Core Classics,59.95,85,93,62,4,5,5,"Sensational.
I have a wide foot and I didn't think these shoes would work, but they did!! Love them."
Vans,Old Skool™ Core Classics,59.95,85,93,62,5,5,5,These shoes are great. I would definitely recommend them to anyone. They look and feel nice. All black goes with anything so it's a great choice. No problems so far and I have them in white too. They're very durable. I got them within 2 days with standard shipping so get yours too!
Vans,Old Skool™ Core Classics,59.95,85,93,62,5,5,5,"These shoes rock! If you're wanting that classy Vans look, but still want something a tad bit different, the Vans Old Skool in all black are the way to go! I grew up skateboarding, and honestly Vans were the first pair skate shoes I ever owned. So naturally I was stoked when the Vans Slip-ons became popular about 5-6 years ago, but I always wanted to be able to match something that was hip and classy with something that actually resembled a skate shoe. When I dress up for a wedding, I'm certainly not wearing dress shoes, but I'm also not wearing those huge boxy skate shoes that have also become popular. Outside of that, these shoes are extremely comfortable and durable. I'd say even more so than the Vans Slip-ons or Authentics. This is coming from a guy who now owns a variety of indoor and outdoor shoes. In other words, I've worn a stupid amount of shoes over the years and these stand up above the many. Not only do the Vans Old Skool Core Classics meet that need to be comfortable and classy while remaining totally rad, but excuse me, they are the standard. If the Vans Old Skool Core Classics are good enough still for Steve Cab or Dave Grohl to continue wearing, then they're absolutely still good enough for me to wear, to anything... Scratch that, everything (even weddings and scholarship ceremonies)."
Vans,Old Skool™ Core Classics,59.95,85,93,62,1,1,1,"Didn't know they were canvas - 
I bought these for my husband, who only wears Van's or sandals. I didn't realize they were canvas, and he didn't really want canvas, so I will be returning them. I ordered him some other Van's that are leather, and he loves them as always."
Vans,Old Skool™ Core Classics,59.95,85,93,62,5,5,5,I purchased these shoes for my 15 yr old daughter..the style of shoe has caused me several calls from her friends for the link so they too may purchase the same shoe..becoming very popular here
Vans,Old Skool™ Core Classics,59.95,85,93,62,3,5,5,A true Vans classic. Brings me back to my youth. It's a simple sneaker with the best board feel in the business.

Vans,Classic Slip-On™ Core Classics,49.95,82,92,59,5,5,2,"This shoes look awesome but are horribly uncomfortable. Insufficient insole padding, and absolutely no padding at the heel aside from a little ridge right along the lip of the heel (which digs into my heel, causing more pain than comfort). I've had to add aftermarket Dr. Scholl's insoles and moleskin padding at the heel to make these even halfway tolerable, and they still hurt the bottoms and backs of my heels after a couple hours of wear. This is a huge disappointment as I have a different pair of lace-up vans that has none of these issues and is super-comfortable. Also, I've noticed that Vans all tend to run a size smaller than labeled (e.g. their 12 is actually an 11, their 13 is actually a 12, etc)."
Vans,Classic Slip-On™ Core Classics,49.95,82,92,59,4,4,3,"OK, these shoes look awesome, especially when you rock them at the Indianapolis 500, but don't do what I did and not wear them with out socks when they came straight from the box, unless you love the pains of blisters. I am sure as I break them in and they wear a little bit, they will get more comfortable."
Vans,Classic Slip-On™ Core Classics,49.95,82,92,59,4,5,4,"Shoes for my Dad - 
My Dad loves canvas slip-ons which are getting harder and harder to find. the last two years I have oedered Vans from Zappos and he likes them a great deal. Zappos also gave me free shipping for my order and the shoes arrived in a timely fashion. Keep up the good work, Zappos!

Vans,Classic Slip-On™ Core Classics,49.95,82,92,59,3,5,4,"A Classic! -
What can you say about Vans that hasn't already been said? They're a classic. The cool thing about this particular pair is the groovy design involving bees and the color orange - my favorite. Thanks!"
Vans,Classic Slip-On™ Core Classics,49.95,82,92,59,5,5,4,"Very good!
The shoe is very comfortable and I like the look. Based on this I will purchase this brand in the future."
Vans,Classic Slip-On™ Core Classics,49.95,82,92,59,3,5,4,"Great slip on - 
This is a great slip on shoe that can be worn with shorts or jeans. It does run a bit big so order a 1/2 size smaller than you normally would. It saves the hassle of returns."
Vans,Classic Slip-On™ Core Classics,49.95,82,92,59,4,5,4,"Alright shoe, insole tore quick though and you really gotta take care of 'em or they will fade and stains are hard to take off."

Vans,Classic Slip-On™ Core Classics,49.95,82,92,59,5,5,5,"Super surprise gift - 
My son grew up wearing Vans and he was tickled 
and thrilled to get a pair of actual Vans after all these years (he's 27). Zappos was very helpful in the ordering process. I had a small problem when ordering with my computer. They were right there to help me and fix the order. We got them very fast. One part of the Zappos policy that I thought was really great is that they can be returned if anything is wrong for one full year. It's not likely that this will happen but that policy is there just in case. It gives the customer a good feeling. I give Zappos an A+ in their overall policy and handling of orders and customers."
Vans,Classic Slip-On™ Core Classics,49.95,82,92,59,5,5,5,"These are the best shoes I own!  I am on my 5th pair of Van Slip-Ons.  Perfect shoes for work, skating, and just hanging out."

Vans,Classic Slip-On™ Core Classics,49.95,82,92,59,5,5,5,As always Zappos delivered fast. Shoe was a good fit and always in style. It did give me that infamous blister on my Achilles for about a week. But other than that a great shoe at a great price.
Vans,Classic Slip-On™ Core Classics,49.95,82,92,59,5,5,5,"Shoes and delivery service were both great, not to mention the price and and the ease of ordering. Have placed other orders & have never been disappointed."

Vans,Classic Slip-On™ Core Classics,49.95,82,92,59,5,5,5,"Bought this pair of shoes for my boyfriend, and he absolutely loves them. They're a bit snug if worn with thick socks, but he wears them all the time now, loves the color, and says they are super comfortable."

Vans have always in my opinion had the most consistency in sizing over the years. I have been wearing Vans since the Early 80's and have never had a pair that hasn't fit. I know that any time I walked into a place and just grabbed an 8.5 and purchased it without even trying it on, it would fit. When a shoe hasn't modified it's fit in 20+ years you just always know what you're getting. I will be buying more shoes from Zappos as the need presents it's self. You guys are proving yourself fast and reliable and this is just my first order."
Vans,Era™  Core Classics,49.95,88,93,59,5,5,5,"These shoes are great! They go with everything and I am definitely ordering a pair in blue. (However they have no arch support, but I don't mind). And as usual Zappos shipping is phenomenal. I ordered them at 10pm and they arrived at my house midday the next day! Great experience and love the shoes."
Vans,Era™  Core Classics,49.95,88,93,59,5,5,5,"Wow, I love these shoes. They look great on just about everyone and they match with basiclly everything. The only down side of these shoes is that after walking for a while, they are not the most comfortable things in the world. GET THESE SHOES!!"
Vans,Era™  Core Classics,49.95,88,93,59,5,5,5,Hi I ordered my Vans and received them 4 days later. Which is very good because I live in Australia. They are very comfortable. This is my 4th pair of Vans. And Zappos is the cheapest place I could find to buy Vans- about 60% cheaper than the stores

Zappos is the only place to order your Vans. Overnight FREE shipping and no sales tax saves you money not even mentioning not having to search the malls for the perfect shoes. Being a mother of teenagers, they know what they want and I save time and money. The Vans SK8-Hi's are very cool shoes! Zappos is the only place for Vans as far as I'm concerned. Thanks again for another great sale!!!"

Also, kind of overpriced.
I love Zappos, though! Great service, fast shipping!"

Vans,Old Skool Platform,64.95,81,96,81,5,5,5,I wanted something cute to wear with a dress to a concert so I could dance. I did not want them to be a one off. I wanted them to be something cute I would wear with other things as well. These gold Vans fit the bill. I have already got a ton of compliments on them. I was able to dance the night away and my feet were so happy. I can't recommend these enough!
