Saucony Originals,Jazz Low Pro,42.99,87,95,70,5,5,5,0,-5,-5,"I love these shoes. I've had probably 5 or 6 pairs over the last 4-5 years. They're my go-to everyday sneaker, whether I'm going to work, the bar, or just running errands on the weekend. They're affordable, which is good since they do tend to wear out after 8-12 months of solid wear. For the price, I'd say that's a pretty fair deal. I usually take out the insole and put in some Superfeet for a little extra support and stability, since what's there is minimal. They look great with jeans or shorts, and while I wouldn't recommend using them as an actual running shoe, they're great for almost everything else. I've tried branching out to other brands and styles, but I always end up coming back to these. Plus, great colors. The Saucony Jazz Lo Pro rules, and Zappos rules, too."
